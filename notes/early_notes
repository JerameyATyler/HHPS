Bad things happen. When they do, many of us want to help out but don’t think we can make a difference. How can one person make a difference when the problem is so big? Well, what if while you helped two other people who saw you help decided they should help too? And what if other people decided to help because they saw those helpers? Did your little bit of help make a difference? 

If we look at the help you gave by itself then it’s hard to imagine that you made a difference. But if we look at the help you gave combined with the help of the people you inspired and the help of the people they inspired and so on. Now it looks like you made a big difference because you actually did! 

So what can you do help? What do you care about? Do something to help, anything. It doesn’t have to be big. Pick up trash on your walk to school. Go to an elderly home and visit people. Donate blood. No help is too small. After you help, let us know and let your friends and family know. We can show you how much of an impact you’ve had. Your impact may be big and your impact may be small but regardless you made an impact.

How does it work? Well it’s really simple. Do something and let us know. We’ll do the rest.   When we all work together imagine the impact we can make.

Idea: Share an image on social media of a person performing a predetermined hand gesture. Facial recognition adds them to the network. Mention us by name in the post, hashtag the cause (network), and perform our hand sign in the picture. That’s it, we’ll show you how big of an impact you’ve made.
